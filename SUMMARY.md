## **SUMMARY OF MY UNDERSTANDING OF CONCEPTS**


- **SPRING**
  - This is a framework that allows us developers to write robust web applications and APIs
  - It simplifies the process of creating applications with its features like Dependency Injection which is handled by the Inversion of Control using beans.

- **IOC**
  - Spring Inversion of Control is a design principle which transfers the creation of objects and dependency management to the spring container. 
  - The container then creates and inject the beans where needed, instead of manually handling the creation and injection.
  - Objects that are managed by the IOC are marked using annotations such as(@Service. @Component, @Repository etc.).
  - Sometimes the objects can also be marked using XML or Java code.

- **REST**
  - This is an architectural way of writing or developing APIs that allow different kinds of applications to communicate using the standard HTTP methods(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.
  - The data that is being transferred between the applications are in a form of JSON or XML
